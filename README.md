# 311Proj1

Simple project for COSC 311 that simulates a restaraunt queue, providing optimal minimum, maximum, average, and cumulative wait times.  
Simulation has a variable amount of servers that determine the service times, as well as a business factor that is used for a poisson 
distribution that determines how many customers come, and when.
